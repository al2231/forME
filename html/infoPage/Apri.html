        <p>Generic name: ethinyl estradiol and desogestrel</p>
        <hr class="bchr">
        <p>Apri is a combination birth control pill containing female hormones that prevent ovulation 
        (the release of an egg from an ovary). Apri also causes changes in your cervical mucus and 
        uterine lining, making it harder for sperm to reach the uterus and harder for a fertilized egg 
        to attach to the uterus.</p>
        <hr class="bchr">
        <h3>Warnings</h3>
        <p>Taking birth control pills can increase your risk of blood clots, stroke, or heart attack. 
        You are even more at risk if you have high blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol, 
        or if you are overweight. Your risk of stroke or blood clot is highest during your first 
        year of taking birth control pills. Your risk is also high when you restart birth control 
        pills after not taking them for 4 weeks or longer.</p>
        <p>Smoking can increase your risk of blood clots, stroke, or heart attack caused by birth control
        pills, especially if you are older than 35.</p>
        <p>If you become pregnant. Stop using Apri and tell your doctor right away if you become 
        pregnant, or if you miss two menstrual periods in a row. If you have recently had a baby, 
        wait at least 4 weeks before taking birth control pills.</p>
