        <hr class="bchr">
        <p>Aviane is a combination birth control pill containing female hormones that prevent ovulation 
        (the release of an egg from an ovary). Aviane also causes changes in your cervical mucus and
        uterine lining, making it harder for sperm to reach the uterus and harder for a fertilized 
        egg to attach to the uterus.</p>
        <p>Take your first pill on the first day of your period or on the first Sunday after your period
        begins. You may need to use back-up birth control, such as condoms</p>
        <p>You should chew the chewable tablet (pill) and then swallow it with a glass of water, or if you
        prefer you should swallow the chewable tablet (pill) whole. Take it on an empty stomach.</p>
        <p>You may have breakthrough bleeding, especially during the first 3 months. Tell your doctor if this 
        bleeding continues or is very heavy.</p>

        <h3>Warnings</h3>
        <p>You should not use Aviane if you have: uncontrolled high blood pressure, heart disease, coronary 
        artery disease, circulation problems (especially with diabetes), undiagnosed vaginal bleeding, liver
        disease or liver cancer, severe migraine headaches, if you also take certain hepatitis C medication, if
        you will have major surgery, if you smoke and are over 35, or if you have ever had a heart attack, 
        a stroke, a blood clot, jaundice caused by pregnancy or birth control pills, or cancer of the breast, 
        uterus/cervix, or vagina.</p>
