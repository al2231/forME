        <p>Combination oral contraceptives act by suppression of gonadotropins. Although the primary 
        mechanism of this action is inhibition of ovulation, other alterations include changes in the 
        cervical mucus (which increase the difficulty of sperm entry into the uterus) and the endometrium 
        (which reduce the likelihood of implantation)</p>

        <h3>Warnings</h3>
        <p>The use of oral contraceptives is associated with increased risks of several serious conditions 
        including venous and arterial thrombotic and thromboembolic events (such as myocardial infarction, 
        thromboembolism, and stroke), hepatic neoplasia, gallbladder disease, and hypertension, although the 
        risk of serious morbidity or mortality is very small in healthy women without underlying risk factors. 
        The risk of morbidity and mortality increases significantly in the presence of other underlying risk 
        factors such as certain inherited or acquired thrombophilias, hypertension, hyperlipidemias, obesity, 
        diabetes, and surgery or trauma with increased risk of thrombosis</p>
